## 🧠 AI Agent - ADK + Gemini API

The **AI Time Assistant using Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** is a Python-based project built to demonstrate how intelligent conversational agents can be developed using **Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash model**. This project serves as a foundational guide for understanding how Google’s ADK enables developers to design, configure, and deploy custom AI agents capable of performing specific tasks with natural language interaction. The AI Time Assistant focuses on a simple yet effective use case — responding to user queries about the current time in different cities. This is achieved using a mock tool named `get_current_time`, which integrates seamlessly with the ADK framework to simulate real-time data retrieval and response generation.  

The project begins by setting up a clean Python virtual environment and installing the `google-adk` package, which provides the necessary components to build and run agents locally. It introduces the concept of defining an **agent configuration**, where developers can specify the model, agent name, purpose, and tools. In this case, the main agent (`root_agent`) uses the Gemini 2.5 Flash model, designed for efficient, low-latency interactions, making it ideal for conversational AI. By defining a simple function `get_current_time(city: str)`, the project shows how user-defined tools can be integrated into an AI agent to extend its capabilities beyond text generation — bridging the gap between conversational understanding and actionable responses.  

A key highlight of this project is the integration of secure authentication using the `.env` file. The **Gemini API key** is stored in this file, ensuring that sensitive credentials are never hard-coded into the source code. This approach promotes best practices for managing API access in production-ready AI projects. The ADK framework automatically loads the key from the environment, enabling secure communication between the agent and Google’s generative AI services. In addition, the modular project structure — containing `agent.py`, `__init__.py`, `.env`, and the virtual environment folder — aligns with professional Python packaging standards, making the project easy to maintain and scale for more complex use cases in the future.  

Once the setup is complete, the project demonstrates how the agent can be executed in two ways: through the **command-line interface (CLI)** using `adk run my_agent`, and via the **web-based interface** using `adk web --port 8000`. The CLI provides a terminal-based conversational experience where users can type queries such as “What time is it in New York?” and receive instant responses. The web interface, accessible through `http://localhost:8000`, offers a modern chat-based environment where users can interact with the same agent visually. This dual-interface design highlights the versatility of ADK — allowing both developers and non-technical users to engage with AI models intuitively.  

Beyond its immediate functionality, the **AI Time Assistant** project serves as an educational and developmental resource for those interested in exploring **generative AI applications**. It demonstrates how ADK can be used to build agents that combine natural language processing, logical reasoning, and tool-based execution. By following this structure, developers can expand the project to integrate real-time APIs, such as weather data, calendar management, or IoT control systems, creating agents capable of performing complex tasks. Ultimately, this project exemplifies the process of transforming a language model into a fully functional, customizable, and interactive AI assistant — laying the groundwork for the next generation of intelligent software agents powered by Google’s Gemini technology.
