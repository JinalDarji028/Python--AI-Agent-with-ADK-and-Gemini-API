## 🧠 AI Agent - ADK + Gemini API

The **🕒 AI Time Assistant using Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** is an exciting Python-based project that demonstrates how to build an intelligent conversational agent powered by **Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash model ⚡️**. Designed for both developers and students, this project serves as a practical guide to understanding how Google’s ADK can be used to create, customize, and interact with AI-driven agents capable of performing real-world tasks. In this implementation, the agent functions as a **virtual time assistant** 🧭 that can tell the current time in any city using a mock tool called `get_current_time`.  

✨ **The primary goal of this project** is to showcase how **generative AI models 🤖** can be integrated with user-defined tools to bridge the gap between intelligent reasoning and actionable automation. By embedding customized functionality into the ADK framework, the project demonstrates how AI can handle practical tasks such as time queries, information lookups, and domain-specific operations. This integration illustrates how developers can turn a language model into an interactive, context-aware digital assistant capable of producing meaningful, human-like responses.  

🧩 **The project architecture** follows a clean, modular, and extensible design, making it beginner-friendly yet powerful. It introduces key components of Google’s ADK, including the `Agent` class, model configuration, and tool integration. The `root_agent` is configured with a clear **description**, **instruction**, and **tool mapping**, enabling it to process user prompts efficiently and provide relevant answers. Security and reliability are emphasized through the use of an `.env` file to store the **Gemini API key 🔐**, following best practices for managing sensitive credentials across development environments.  

💻 **The AI Time Assistant** can be executed in two modes of interaction — via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and a **Web-based User Interface (UI)** 🌐. The CLI allows users to chat directly with the agent in real time, while the web interface (accessible at `http://localhost:8000`) provides an intuitive, browser-based chat experience. This dual-interface setup showcases the flexibility of the ADK framework and how it can support both local testing and scalable deployments. Developers can further expand the project by adding more APIs or tools such as real-time weather forecasts 🌦️, financial data 💹, or geolocation insights 🗺️ to enhance the agent’s functionality.  

🚀 Ultimately, this project provides a **hands-on, end-to-end learning experience** for understanding how AI agents are built, configured, and deployed within the **Google ADK ecosystem**. It combines the principles of **large language model integration**, **secure environment setup**, and **custom tool design** to serve as a blueprint for creating practical AI solutions. The **AI Time Assistant ⏰** is not just a simple time-telling bot—it’s a stepping stone toward developing fully autonomous, task-oriented agents that can interact naturally, automate workflows, and deliver meaningful results using **Google’s state-of-the-art Gemini AI technology 🪄**.
